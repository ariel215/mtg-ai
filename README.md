_Teaching computers to play Magic: the Gathering_

The goal of this project is to implement enough of the rules of Magic: the Gathering
to be able to develop learning algorithms for the game. It's starting with Walls,
an off-meta combo deck, because it's a deck that I happen to be interested in, but
ultimately the goal is to be able to learn a wide variety of decks.
